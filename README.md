# Anchor-Time
Using VALORANT Champions Time data to find the best achor players on Breeze

Anchor time:

The time a defender lives for while solo anchoring a site on defence.
It is usually best for comparing anchor agents such as a Cypher, Astra , Viper and Omen.
An Example: Viper on Breeze B Site


We filter out all deaths after the spike has been planted:
1. An anchor has failed his task if the spike is planted
1.a: i.e he dies and the site is over run
1.b: he falls back and plays retake with the team

Either way the site is lost and hence the anchor time is only calculated pre spike-plant
